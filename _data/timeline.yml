  description: <p>This is where I started my journey. At the time, I knew very little, but I felt that learning how to draw would help me build a more solid artistic foundation. I decided to enroll in a mixed course in Concept Art and 3D Modeling focused on pre-visualization and offline rendering.</p>
               <p>I was right, I learned how to loosen up my hand, as well as a lot of theory that today allows me to read each piece accurately, about what it wants to achieve and how it does it.</p>
               <p>As time went by, however, I realized I missed the satisfaction that comes from solving problems through technical creativity. So, after finishing my second year, I decided to shift my focus entirely on 3D art for video games.</p>
