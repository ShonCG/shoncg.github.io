# **About Me**

Growing up I always thought “Man, videogames are truly something magical, I wonder how they're actually made”. When I was about 13, I decided I wanted to really understand it, so I downloaded Unity 4. Since then I've never stopped being passionate about videogame development.

I’m a technical artist specialized in low-end hardware such as <b>consoles</b>, <b>mobile</b>, and <b>VR</b>, where performance constraints turn into creative challenges. Tech art is a unique discipline that allows me to blend analytical thinking with creativity, both of which I love.

My drive to understand how things work has never left me, and I bring it into every project. What I don’t know doesn’t intimidate me, it motivates me. Learning, experimenting, and solving new problems is what keeps this work exciting.
